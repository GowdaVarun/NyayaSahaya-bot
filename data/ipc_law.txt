FOREWORD
After having served as the fulcrum of criminal justice
administration for over 150 years, with several amendments and
upgrades, the erstwhile three Criminal Major Laws have recently
been replaced by Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Nagarik
Suraksha Sanhita and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam through
Acts of Parliament. The enactment of the three new Criminal
Major Acts marks a significant post-colonial shift in the criminal
justice administration of our country; the distinguishing feature
being focus on ‘justice’ from conventionally being purely ‘penal’.
The new laws aim at structural overhaul of criminal justice
administration by acknowledging the changes that have taken
roots in a developing country and society over the past century
and, are futuristic in-as-much as they aim at providing a
cohesive definition and prescribing the consequences of new age
delinquencies in a rational, just and nationalistic framework.
The new laws are expected to be notified for implementation in
the coming days. It is going to be a multi-stakeholder endeavour
wherein central organizations like NCRB, BPR&D etc. will play
an important role along with State Police forces. For on-ground 
understanding and implementation of the new laws, Delhi
Police has already taken the first step with the preparation of this
comprehensive Handbook, which shows the commitment and
perseverance of our Training Division, under the able leadership
of Ms. Chhaya Sharma, Spl.CP/Training.
The challenge with adoption and implementation of the new
laws is primarily ‘attitudinal’. For a police force accustomed to
learning, practicing and internalizing laws that have been the
‘daily bread’ of policing for generations of police officers, the first
challenge is to acknowledge that development is de-envelopment
i.e., the old yolk is to be done away with. The process of unlearning
and re-learning can indeed be very difficult in absence of
experienced mentors, quality study material and structured,
practical tutoring. The Handbook at hand aims to fill the critical
second paradigm mentioned above, while we scout and prepare
professional trainers and lay down a calendar for training over
seventy thousand personnel of Delhi Police on this journey of
excitement and discoveries.
I once again extend my heartfelt compliments to the
entire team of Training Division of Delhi Police, who worked
assiduously, ably assisted by experts drawn from various
professions into drafting the Handbook and I am sure that this
will serve as the beacon light for not just Delhi Police but several
other State Police forces, who are moving along with us into the
future of national service through our policing efforts.

Commissioner of Police, Delhi
PREFACE

Sections in 20 Chapters whereas there was modification of
total 511 sections in 23 + 3 Chapters in the I.P.C. where in
20 new sections have been added in BNS and 20 provisions
of I.P.C have been deleted. A committee was constituted

been made to help the Investigating Officers and simplify the
understanding of the new ‘Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita – 2023’
for the police officers of Delhi Police.

of BNS with five annexures which depict different types
of offences and their fines/punishments. The newly added
and modified sections have been highlighted and nature

given for ease of the readers.
Our goal is to make the shift smooth, offering practical
insights that empower you on the ground. As you navigate
this legal update, consider this booklet your go-to resource for
understanding and implementing these changes effectively.
Together, let us ensure a seamless transition, enhancing our
collective commitment to justice and community safety as
well as making Delhi Police one of the best organizations to

General Overview About
Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita,

Dated 25th December 2023)
•	 The new Act is called as“Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023”, (BNS) which has

numbering of sections / chapters in BNS.
•	 The Chapters/sections for offences against women & children and offences
affecting the human body (murder) have been given precedence. Further,
the offences against women and children which were scattered throughout
in the erstwhile IPC have been brought together and have been consolidated
under Chapter-V. In the same manner, the offences affecting the Human
body are also brought up in the order and placed there after in Chapter VI.
•	 All 3 incomplete categories of offences, i.e. Attempt, Abetment &

and terrorist act have been added in the Sanhita with deterrent punishments.
Sections 111 & 113 of the BNS 2023 punish the commission, attempt,
abetment, conspiracy of organised crimes and terrorist acts respectively.
Both the Sections also punish the act of being a member of any organised
crime syndicate or terrorist organisation, harboring or concealing any
person who committed any organised crime or Terrorist act and the act
of possessing any property derived or obtained from the commission of
organised crime or terrorist act. Section 111 on organised crime takes care
of various state laws enacted in this domain. Section 113 on terrorist act has
been drafted on the lines of UAPA. It has also been provided that in case of
the offence of terrorist act, officer not below the rank of SP will decide
whether to register a case under the provisions of BNS, 2023 or UAPA.
•	 A new offence for having sexual intercourse on false promise of marriage,
employment, promotion or by suppressing the identity etc. has been
introduced in Section 69 of the BNS. This provision will be a deterrent

punishment for such acts of grievous hurt which results in persistent
vegetative state or in permanent disability, it will attract higher punishment

BNS Handbook Delhi Police Academy
10 Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023
but which may extend to imprisonment for life (remainder of that person’s
natural life) as against up to 7 years imprisonment for grievous hurt earlier
in IPC.
•	 Punishment of Fine has been enhanced in 83 offences. (Annexure-IV)
Fine of 10/-, 100/-, 200/-, 250/-500/- etc. have been enhanced to 1000,

(Annexure-V) viz. buying child for the purpose of prostitution, organised
crime, terrorist act, hurt to deter public servant from his duty, personating
a public servant, theft etc.
•	 For the 1st time “Community Service” has been introduced as one of the
punishments specifically provided for 6 petty offences mentioned below.
It introduces the reformative approach in the punishment scheme which is
aimed towards achieving ‘NYAYA’ in the society
(1) Public Servant unlawfully engaging in trade u/s 202 BNS.
(2) Non-appearance in response to a proclamation published under sub
section (i) of section 84 of BNSS is punishable u/s 209 BNS.

power of public servant u/s 226 BNS.

first time U/s 303(2) BNS.

(6) Defamation u/s 356 BNS.
•	 Assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe her u/s 76
of BNS and Voyeurism u/s 77 of BNS has been made Gender neutral. The
offence relating to importation of a person from foreign country has also
been made gender neutral to cover both boys and girls in Section 141 of
the BNS, 2023. It will protect the minor boys and girls from being used for
the purposes of forced or seduced illicit intercourse.
•	 Age based parameters for differential punishment (for gang rape of 
BNS Handbook Delhi Police Academy
Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023 11
a minor girl) has been removed and now Section 70(2) prescribes life
imprisonment (till remainder of that person’s natural life) or death for gang
rape of a woman below the age of 18 years.
•	 Definition of Child is added in Sec. 2 (3) and transgender has been
included in the definition of ‘Gender’ Sec. 2(10) as any person including
transgender with male and female. Uniformity has been introduced in the
use of expression ‘child’ throughout the BNS, 2023 which is achieved by
replacing the expression ‘minor’ and ‘child under the age of eighteen years’
with the word ‘child’.
•	 Replacing ‘Night’ with ‘after sunset and before sunrise’.
•	 Movable property includes tangible as well as intangible property. [Sec 2
(21)]
•	 Section 303 (2) of the BNS, 2023 presents a fine example of deterrence
and reformative approach of punishment. On the one hand, for a second
conviction of any person ‘for theft’, the section prescribes a higher
punishment up to 5 years with a mandatory minimum of 1 year, on the
other hand where the value of stolen property is less than 5,000 rupees
and the first-time offender restores the stolen property, the punishment of
community service has only been prescribed.
